    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
    <p>I’m Flavia Christo and I’m here to share my plant-based food passion with all of you.</p> 
    <p>I became vegan in February 2016 after watching a documentary about all the horrible things that the food industry does to our health and the environment.</p> Since then, I’ve been discovering a whole new world of colors, flavors, nutrients, and amazing options within this lifestyle. I believe that the combination between education, good food and lots of fun is what make people engaged and inspired. I hope I can give you a taste of it too!</p>
